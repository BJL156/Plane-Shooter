# Plane Shooter
Made in one day from scratch. My first attempt on a game with OpenGL.

## About Game
The game was inspired by the second phase in a boss fight in *Cuphead* called *Djimmi The Great*. In the second phase of the fight the player is in a plane with pillars moving towards them. The only way to get past the pillars is to shoot and break a part in the pillar.

## Controls
(w, a, s, d) - Movement
(Left Mouse) - Shoot

(r) - Reset
