# Plane Shooter
Made in one day from scratch. My first attempt on a game with OpenGL.

**It is also important to note that some crashing may occur becuase of Irrklang. I may look into it more although I am not sure if I will simply becauase this was a one off thing.**

**This project can also be found on Itch.io where it can also be downloaded for completely free: https://bjl156.itch.io/plane-shooter**

## About Game
The game was inspired by the second phase in a boss fight in *Cuphead* called *Djimmi The Great*. In the second phase of the fight the player is in a plane with pillars moving towards them. The only way to get past the pillars is to shoot and break a part in the pillar.

## Controls
